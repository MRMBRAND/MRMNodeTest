# MRM Brand node excercise

MRM deals with many companies and handles a lot of product data.

Your job will be to build a very simple product database API.

In this repository you will find a JSON file: `product.json` with some product data. Each product will have the following fields:

```json
{
  "name": "XXXXX",
  "description": "XXXX",
  "category": "XXXX"
}
```

You will need to perform the following tasks:

1. Create a node backend application and database using the framework of your choice. Create database migration and load scripts to support the data.
2. Create API endpoints that support the following operations:
  1. Retrieve all products
  2. Retrieve a list of categories
  3. Retrieve the products for a category
  4. Creation of a new product (and if necessary the category for that product)
  5. Deletion of a product

This is intended to be a creative exercise so the structure of the data stored in the database and the organisation of the APIs is left as a design decision for you.

Your completed project should include instructions on how to set the project up and run it.
